= Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry Connector

[[spring-cloud-connectors-install]]


This connector will discover services bound to an application running in Cloud Foundry.  It currently knows about:

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* Oracle
* Redis
* MongoDB
* RabbitMQ
* SMTP gateway
* application monitoring (New Relic)

Since Cloud Foundry enumerates each service in a consistent format, Spring Cloud does not care which service provider is providing it.

== Supporting new service types

Extend `CloudFoundryServiceInfoCreator` with a creator for <<spring-cloud-core.adoc#_adding_service_discovery,your service's `ServiceInfo` class>>.

Add the fully-qualified class name for your creator to

META-INF/service/org.springframework.cloud.cloudfoundry.CloudFoundryServiceInfoCreator
