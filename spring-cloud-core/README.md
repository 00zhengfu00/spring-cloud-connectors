#Spring Cloud Core

This core library provides programmatic access to application and service information; it has no Spring dependencies and may be used in non-Spring applications. See [the documentation](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-connectors.html#_spring_cloud_connectors_core).
