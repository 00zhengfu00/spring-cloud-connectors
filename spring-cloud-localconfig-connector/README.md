#Spring Cloud local-configuration connector

This connector provides the ability to configure Spring Cloud services locally for development or testing. The current implementation reads from Java properties only; pull requests for also inspecting environment variables are welcome.

See [the documentation](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-connectors.html#_local_configuration_connector) for more information.
